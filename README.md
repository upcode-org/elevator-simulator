Elevator Challenge

 

The application is an elevator simulation, where the user can set the amount of floors and elevators in a building before starting the simulation.

 

A request can be made from any floor to go up or down to any other floor to pickup a person. There needs to be a minimum of 2 elevators in the simulation. There can be multiple requests.

 

When an elevator request is made, the unoccupied elevator closest to it will answer the call, unless an occupied elevator is moving and will pass that floor on its way.  The elevators cannot climb above or go below the amount of floors available.

 

The exception is that if an unoccupied elevator is already stopped at that floor, then it will always have the highest priority answering that call.

 

After an elevator has made 100 trips, that elevator needs service, it will not be able to attend to any other requests until it has been serviced.

 

Preferably this app should be coded with Javascript/Typescript. The developer should not spend more than 2 to 6 hrs on this project, there is no need to finish it they can stub the methods/classes with comments in the code, explaining what they would do.
